# BankNote_Authentication - Kaushal Rao 
For this project, we'll use the [Bank Authentication Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) from the UCI repository, which contains image data from bank notes and whether or not the bank note was authentic (denoted by 0 or 1 in the "class" column). 

The data consists of 5 columns:

* variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
* entropy of image (continuous)
* class (integer)

We will be using a neural network (DNN) to predict (binary classification) if a particular bank note is authentic!
